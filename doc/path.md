# Path

Grabbag use path to pick value from PHP elements
```php
$result = Grabbag::grab($node, 'that/is/a/path');
```
For example could be similar to php expression :
```php
$node->getThat()->is['a']['path']
```
Grabbag Path looks like (on purpose) Linux path syntax to be familiar and easy use.
.


## Path items

Path items are separated by slashes (so are the directories in linux path).
Let's see one simple example in raw PHP and its equivalent Grabbag path.

PHP
```php
myObject->myMethod()['myArrayKey']
```
Grabbag path : 
```
/myObject/myMethod/myArrayKey
```

## Path syntax

In a path, array keys or object properties can be accessed the same way : 
```
/myObject/myProperty
/myArray/myKey
```
No need to use distinct syntax as in raw PHP :
```php
$myObject->myProperty
$myArray['myKey']
```
'get' can be omitted from getter methods name so can be the parenthesis if no parameter is required.

Following paths are equivalent. 

```
/myObject/getSometing()
/myObject/something()
/myObject/something
```
Method items can only have one parameter provided for now : Method items aims to access getter method. one parameter is all we need in that case.  

Following paths are equivalent. 
```
/myObject/getSometing("param")
/myObject/something("param")
```

## Query, a quick overview

We talked about path till now ? flub! we would have talk about query !

in fact, the second parameter Grabbag::grab method accepts is not a path but a query.
All will be explained as soon as i tell you the simplest form of a query is a path.

So now the question is : what a query could be if it's non (only) a path !

#### Path arrays

Path arrays gathers paths in order to produce structured arrays.

**Example :**
```php
[
    "my/first/path",
    "my/second/path"
]
```
**Example result  :** 
```php
['my value #1', 'my value #2',]
```
In query, paths are often prefixed with id (See Path ids) allowing to produce a keyed value in the result.

## Path ids

#### Usage

Path ids are used to identify a path in a query and are located on start of the path and ends with a ':'

It can have 2 usages : 

* Usage 1 : It can be used to specify the value key in the result scope
* Usage 2 : It can be used in a __modifier__ to refer to a path value.

#### Explicit or internal id.

By default, a path id is explicit. It means id is used in the result scope as a key for the value(s) the path collect.

If you want to avoid the key to be used in result scope you must prefix it with "~". Such ids are called internal ids.

Usage 1 example : 

```php
[
    "lv-1:my/first/path", //this is an explicit id
    "~lv-2:my/second/path", //this is an internal id
    "lv-3:my/first/path"
]
```
Result example :
```php
[
     "lv-1" => "Result 1",
     "Result 2",
     "lv-3" => "Result 3"
 ]
```
#### Ids and modifiers

Internal or explicit ids can be used with modifiers to alter the path result.

An example using transform modifier :

```php
[
    "lv-1:my/first/path", //this is an explicit id
    "~lv-2:my/second/path", //this is an internal id
    "lv-3:my/first/path",
    "?transform" => function($value, $id){
        if($id === "~lv-2"){
            return '>>>' . $value . '<<<';
        }
    }
]
```
```php
[
     "lv-1" => "Result 1",
     ">>>Result 2<<<",
     "lv-3" => "Result 3"
 ]
```
## Query, let's go further

We've seen that the simplest form of a query is a Path, 
We've seen to that a Query can be a path array, using or not ids.

Fine. Let's make a step ahead.

### Embedded path arrays

In a query, Path arrays can be embedded in order to produce leveled structured results. 
Each path array can contain paths or embedded path arrays that will be resolved to produce results in the 
related result scope.

Embedded path arrays example : 

```php
[
    "my-key-A:my/first/path",
    "my-key-B:my/second/path" => [
        "my-key-AA:continue/here",
        "my-key-AB:continue/there"
    ]
    "my-key-C:my/first/path",
]
```

###Â Result scope

Result scope is an important Grabbag concepts.

Let consider the following path : 
```
my/object/#any/continues/#any
```

The result would be something like this : 
```php
[
    "My string 1-1",
    "My string 1-2",
    "My string 2-1",
    "My string 2-2"
]
```
If we now split this path in a query containing 2 embedded path array like this :
 
```php
[
    "my/object/#any" => 
    [
        "continues/#any"
    ]
]
```

We request same objects pretty the same way, but we added an embedded path array having its own result scope. The whole result will now be someting like this :


```php
[
    [
        "My string 1-1",
        "My string 1-2"
    ],
    [
        "My string 2-1",
        "My string 2-2"
    ]
]
```

see the [source code here](../examples/1-my-first-embedded-path-array/example.php);

## Symbols

* . : The element corresponding to the current path item
* .. : The element corresponding to the previout path item

## Keywords

Keywords are path items prefixed by "#" that implements special behaviors.

* [\#any](path-keywords/any-keyword.md)
* [\#key](path-keywords/key-keyword.md)

## Modifiers

In a query, path arrays can contain modifiers.
Modifiers are prefixed using "?" and allows to alter the path array behavior.

* [?unique](query-modifiers/unique-modifier.md)
* [?transform](query-modifiers/transform-modifier.md)
* [?consider](query-modifiers/consider-modifier.md)
* [?keep-array](query-modifiers/keep-array-modifier.md)
* [?default-value](query-modifiers/default-value-modifier.md)
* [?exception-enabled](query-modifiers/exception-enabled-modifier.md)
* [?debug](query-modifiers/debug-modifier.md)
